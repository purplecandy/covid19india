# covid19india

A Flutter project for easily mointoring the COVID-19 India stats.

## Getting Started

This project currently relies on this unoffical repository for fetching all the official data [COVID-19 REST API for India](https://github.com/amodm/api-covid19-in).

I will do a migration to a Firebase project for better reliability in case the project gets dumped.

Feel free to test and contribute to the project:

The project is still in early stages of development, please anything is subject to change.
